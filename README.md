2. In the src folder, you'll find 2 .ipynb files. Namely
    - nyc-taxi-exploratory-data-analysis.ipynb
    - nyc-taxi-predictive-model.ipynb

The first file (nyc-taxi-exploratory-data-analysis.ipynb) contains a series of exploratory data analysis about the new york city taxi data. Here, I was able to provide answers to some of the questions below:
    - What is the distribution of number of passengers per trip?
