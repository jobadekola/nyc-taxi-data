# nyc-taxi-data
This project contains an exploratory data analysis of New York city taxi data. It showed some important charts and insights on how some factors influence taxi fare, Also, it contains a couple of predictive models to predict fare amount based on some predictors.

***Steps to Follow in order to access the .ipynb file:***

1. Locate the src folder
2. In the src folder, you'll find 2 .ipynb files. Namely
    - nyc-taxi-exploratory-data-analysis.ipynb
    - nyc-taxi-predictive-model.ipynb

The first file (nyc-taxi-exploratory-data-analysis.ipynb) contains a series of exploratory data analysis about the new york city taxi data. Here, I was able to provide answers to some of the questions below:

*1. What is the distribution of number of passengers per trip?
2. What is the distribution of payment_type?
3. What is the distribution of fare amount?
4. What is the distribution of tip amount?
5. What is the distribution of total amount?
6. What are top 5 busiest hours of the day?
7. What are the top 10 busiest locations of the city?
8. Which trip has the highest standard deviation of travel time?
9. Which trip has most consistent fares?*
